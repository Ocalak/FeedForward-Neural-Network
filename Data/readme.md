## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) model to [brief description of what your model does]. The implementation includes comprehensive model interpretability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to provide insights into the decision-making process of the neural network.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/PyTorch [replace with what you actually used]
- R for data preprocessing
- SHAP for model interpretation
- [Other relevant libraries/frameworks]

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- R 4.0+ (for data preprocessing)
- Required Python packages listed in requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/FeedForward-Neural-Network.git
   cd FeedForward-Neural-Network
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For data preprocessing, ensure R is installed with required packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "data.table", "caret"))  # Add your specific R packages
   ```

## 📊 Data Processing

The data preprocessing is handled by `Data/Getdata.R`, which:
- [Brief explanation of what your data preprocessing does]
- [Description of input data and output format]

## 🔍 Model Training

The FFNN model is defined and trained in `Models/FFNN.py`:
- Architecture: [Brief description of your network architecture]
- Training procedure: [Brief description of training method]
- Evaluation metrics: [List metrics used]

## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning

The model's hyperparameters are optimized using the script in `Hyperparameter_Tuning/tuning.py`, which implements:
- [Explain tuning approach - grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc.]
- [Key hyperparameters that were tuned]

## 🔮 Model Interpretation

Model interpretability is implemented in `Predict/ShapleyValues.py` using SHAP values to:
- Explain individual predictions
- Identify feature importance
- Visualize feature interactions
